# Voxel Resource Editors

1. Voxel Sprite Editor
2. Voxel Landscape Editor

## 2. Voxel Sprite Editor

### Important

**Before painting** use `F11`/`F12` to resize up to `32 x 32 x 32`.

### Keys

* `Arrow keys` - move cursor up, down, left and right.
* `Page Up`/`Page Down` - move cursor forwards and backwards.
* `Shift + (any of the above)` - resize cursor.
* `Ctrl + c`, `Ctrl + x` and `Ctrl + v` - normal clipboard functions
* `Space` - paint voxel.
* `Tab` - delete voxel.
* `1-0` - change selected colour swatch.
* `Delete` - deletes the current frame.
* `Home` - copies the current frame to end.
* `End` - add blank frame at end.
* `Insert` - insert copy of current frame.
* `Numpad 4/5/6` - previous frame / play and stop animation / next frame.
* `F2` - Save
* `F5` - Load

### How to use

Set up some colour swatches (you can use the mouse for this). Painted voxels are not limited to swatch colours (ie. you can change a swatch colour and the sprite will be unaffected). HOWEVER: if you hold shift while changing a swatch colour, it will re-colour all voxels in the sprite that are the same colour.

**THERE IS NO UNDO FUNCTION BECAUSE UNDO IS HARD. SAVE OFTEN.**
